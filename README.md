# TO DO LIST PROJECT

## About The Project

A [to do list web](https://salty-scrubland-23277.herokuapp.com/) app lets you write, organize, and reprioritize your tasks more efficiently. They also let you attach notes, links, etc to a task 
In many ways, a good to-do app is the ultimate productivity app.

## Requirement

* An Active internet is needed to test the web app
* A PC or Mobile phone works fine but i would recommend a PC for easy navigation to test the app functionality with ease

## Here's some cool features of the Project:
#### 1. A field where user can input new task to be done
#### 2. Create our personal separate To Do List ( just create a new path eg .../NewToDoListName) sample would be shown below with an image so don't worry if you don't understand now. 
#### 3. All list are stored in an online database where you can come back to view it anytime you like (it's there forever unless deleated :) )
#### 4. Once all item in the main page are deleted a default guide on how to use the app come's back immediately unless an item is listed on it.
